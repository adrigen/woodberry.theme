  "readme": "# Web app generator with LESS [![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/robinpokorny/generator-lessapp.png?branch=master)](http://travis-ci.org/robinpokorny/generator-lessapp) [![Built with Grunt](https://cdn.gruntjs.com/builtwith.png)](http://gruntjs.com/)\n\nEdited default [Yeoman](http://yeoman.io) generator for scaffolding out a front-end web app with Twitter Bootstrap in LESS\n\n## Features\n\n* CSS Autoprefixing *(new)*\n* Built-in preview server with LiveReload\n* Automagically compile CoffeeScript & LESS\n* Automagically lint your scripts\n* Automagically wire up your Bower components with [bower-install](#third-party-dependencies).\n* Awesome Image Optimization (via OptiPNG, pngquant, jpegtran and gifsicle)\n* Mocha Unit Testing with PhantomJS\n* Optional - Twitter Bootstrap 3 (in LESS)\n* Optional - Leaner Modernizr builds *(new)*\n\nFor more information on what `generator-lessapp` can do for you, take a look at the [Grunt tasks](https://github.com/robinpokorny/generator-lessapp/blob/master/app/templates/_package.json) used in our `package.json`.\n\n\n## Getting Started\n\n- Install: `npm install -g generator-lessapp`\n- Run: `yo lessapp`\n- Run `grunt` for building and `grunt serve` for preview [*](#serve-note)\n\n\n#### Third-Party Dependencies\n\n*(HTML/CSS/JS/Images/etc)*\n\nThird-party dependencies are managed with [bower-install](https://github.com/stephenplusplus/grunt-bower-install). Add new dependencies using **Bower** and then run the **Grunt** task to load them:\n\n```bash\n  bower install --save jquery\n  grunt bowerInstall\n```\n\nThis works if the package author has followed the [Bower spec](https://github.com/bower/bower.json-spec). If the files are not automatically added to your index.html, check with the package's repo for support and/or file an issue with them to have it updated.\n\nTo manually add dependencies, `bower install depName --save` to get the files, then add a `script` or `style` tag to your `index.html` or an other appropriate place.\n\nThe components are installed in the root of the project at `/bower_components`. To reference them from the `grunt serve` web app `index.html` file, use `src=\"bower_components\"` or `src=\"/bower_components\"`. Treat the references as if they were a sibling to `index.html`.\n\n*Testing Note*: a project checked into source control and later checked out, needs to have `bower install` run from the `test` folder as well as from project root.\n\n\n#### Grunt Serve Note\n\nNote: `grunt server` was previously used for previewing in earlier versions of the project and is being deprecated in favor of `grunt serve`.\n\n\n## Options\n\n* `--skip-install`\n\n  Skips the automatic execution of `bower` and `npm` after scaffolding has finished.\n\n* `--test-framework=<framework>`\n\n  Defaults to `mocha`. Can be switched for another supported testing framework like `jasmine`.\n\n* `--coffee`\n\n  Add support for [CoffeeScript](http://coffeescript.org/).\n\n\n## Contribute\n\nSee the [contributing docs](https://github.com/yeoman/yeoman/blob/master/contributing.md)\n\nNote: We are regularly asked whether we can add or take away features. If a change is good enough to have a positive impact on all users, we are happy to consider it.\n\n## License\n\n[BSD license](http://opensource.org/licenses/bsd-license.php)\n\n[![Bitdeli Badge](https://d2weczhvl823v0.cloudfront.net/robinpokorny/generator-lessapp/trend.png)](https://bitdeli.com/free \"Bitdeli Badge\")\n",
